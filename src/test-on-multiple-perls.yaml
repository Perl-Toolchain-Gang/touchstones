title: Test your code on all supported perls.
level: intermediate
category: interop
description: >
  If you support more than one major version of the perl binary (and you
  should), test your code with the relevant versions before releasing.  When
  using XS, test with both threaded and unthreaded perls, at least.  This
  should include bleadperl, the in-development version of perl that will become
  the next stable release.
tools:
- Travis CI lets you test your code against multiple perls.
