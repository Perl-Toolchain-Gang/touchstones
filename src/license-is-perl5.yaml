title: Use the Perl 5
level: advanced
category: legal
description: >
  Your code might be going into core, or at least be used by people already
  relying on a lot of other Perl code.  Don't complicate lives by picking an
  unusual license.  In fact, don't pick anything other than the standard
  license used with Perl 5 software: the Perl 5 license.  Your `META.json` file
  and LICENSE file should both clearly indicate this.
