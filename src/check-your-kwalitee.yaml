  [CPANTS](https://cpants.cpanauthors.org/) is an automated testing service to
  look for a variety of release quality touchstones.  Some of these touchstones
  are represented here as other tips, but not all.  CPANTS will give you a
  detailed report on what your distribution might be getting wrong (or right).

  [cpants_lint.pl](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-CPANTS-Lint/bin/cpants_lint.pl)
  runs all the CPANTS tests locally against your distribution tarball before
  you release it.
- If you don't want to install the full CPANTS stack locally, you can upload
  your distribution (in trial form) to the CPAN and wait for results on the
  [CPANTS](https://cpants.cpanauthors.org/) site.
